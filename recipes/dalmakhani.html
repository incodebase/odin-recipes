        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The dal makhani is a dish originating in New Delhi,India. It is a modern take on the age-old urad ki dal (black lentil dal also known as Maa ki Dal)</p>
        <p>It is made using urad dal (black lentils) and rajma (red kidney beans) that have been soaked overnight. These are mixed with tomato puree, a selection of herbs and spices that include garam masala, sabzi masala, ginger-garlic paste, and a large amount of butter. The mix is then left to cook overnight on a tandoor so the dal can get a distinct smoky flavor. Finally, it is served with a generous garnish of fresh butter.</p>
