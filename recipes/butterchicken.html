        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Butter chicken or murgh makhani is a curry of chicken in a spiced tomato, butter and cream sauce. It originated in the Indian subcontinent as a curry. It is similar to chicken tikka masala, which uses a tomato paste.</p>
        <p>The curry was developed in the 1950s by Kundan Lal Jaggi, the founder of the Moti Mahal restaurant in Delhi, India. The curry was made by accident by mixing leftover tandoori chicken in a tomato gravy which was rich in butter and cream.</p>
        <p>The chicken is marinated for several hours in a mixture of lemon juice, dahi (yogurt), Kashmiri red chili, salt, garam masala and ginger garlic paste. The marinated chicken is then cooked in a tandoor (traditional clay oven), but may be grilled, roasted, or pan-fried. It is served in a mild curry sauce that includes butter.</p>
        <p>The recipe given below is by chef Ranveer Brar</p>

            <li>Add 1Â½ tsp butter, salt and mix well. Cover the pan for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once the tomatoes are soft, blend the gravy with a hand blender till it's smooth.</li>
            <li>Strain the gravy through a strainer</li>
            <li>Now, the butter chicken will be made with the help of the prepared gravy. In a pan, add the required butter and allow it to melt. Then add the red chilli powder and coriander powder, and cook for a minute.</li>
            <li>Pour the <em>prepared gravy</em>, mix it well and cook for 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add fresh cream, honey, shredded tandoori chicken, mix well and cook for another 3-4 minutes.</li>

Pour ghee into the metal bowl containing the charcoal and then immediately cover the pan with its lid for 2-3 minutes to get the smoky flavour. Once done, remove the charcoal bowl from the pan.</li>
            <li>Now you can serve the butter chicken. Finally, garnish it with fresh cream and coriander sprig. You can serve it with jeera rice or roti.</li>
