        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Butter chicken or murgh makhani is a curry of chicken in a spiced tomato, butter and cream sauce. It originated in the Indian subcontinent as a curry. It is similar to chicken tikka masala, which uses a tomato paste.</p>
        <p>The curry was developed in the 1950s by Kundan Lal Jaggi, the founder of the Moti Mahal restaurant in Delhi, India. The curry was made by accident by mixing leftover tandoori chicken in a tomato gravy which was rich in butter and cream.</p>
        <p>The chicken is marinated for several hours in a mixture of lemon juice, dahi (yogurt), Kashmiri red chili, salt, garam masala and ginger garlic paste. The marinated chicken is then cooked in a tandoor (traditional clay oven), but may be grilled, roasted, or pan-fried. It is served in a mild curry sauce that includes butter.</p>
